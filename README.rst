====================
My Vim configuration
====================

Dependencies :
    * Vundle
    * That's all folks !

Installing
==========

.. code-block:: bash

    cd
    git clone https://github.com/ntimeu/vimconf.git .vim
    cd .vim
    mkdir bundle
    cd bundle
    git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git
    vim +PluginInstall +qall

Once vim has downloaded everything, you can quit it, and you're ready
to roll. Enjoy !
